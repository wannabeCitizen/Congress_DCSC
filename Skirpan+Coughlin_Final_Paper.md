# Congress in the Cloud
**Michael Coughlin and Michael Skirpan**

The Congressional Dataset which includes all of the Congressional Record (i.e., words spoken on the floor), Sub-Committee Hearings, and Votes is a massive and continually-growing set of words that is difficult to access for the common voter.  Currently the only place on the web where Congressional data is stored in an indexable and searchable format is on the [Sunlight Foundation's Web API](http://sunlightfoundation.com/).  While Sunlight's project is a massive step forward, it is still mostly accessible for those computer savvy enough to work with REST APIs.  Our project was aimed at building a cloud infrastructure that would establish the foundation of what is needed to support a web-based search engine allowing end-users the ability to search through congressional records.

## Project Goals

The larger objective of this project will take a lot of front-end design and algorithmic design to support optimized search functionality and natural language processing.  However, for this class our goal was to learn about building distributed systems in the cloud in order to get the working parts of such project going.  Aspects we focused on were:

* Automated configuration of nodes in the cloud
* Distributed data stores
* Basic publisher-subscriber systems
* Crawling and data injestion
* Using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to develop scalable response patterns
