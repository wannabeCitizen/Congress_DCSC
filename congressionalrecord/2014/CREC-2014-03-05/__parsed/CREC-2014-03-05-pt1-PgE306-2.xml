Hazleton Lodge #200 ``2013-2014 Elk of the Year,'' for her loyal 
service to the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.
   Mrs. Pedriani has been a resident of Hazleton, Pennsylvania for 36 
years. After graduating from Mahanoy Area High School, she took post 
graduate courses at Luzerne County Community College and owned her own 
cosmetology business in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Since joining the 
Elks two years ago, Mrs. Pedriani has been an outstanding asset in 
accomplishing lodge goals and is well known for her superb cooking 
abilities.
   Beyond her involvement with the Hazleton Elks, Mrs. Pedriani has 
been an active member of the local community. She served on the board 
of ``Helping Hands'' and is a member of the Holy Rosary Church. In 
2011, she was the keynote speaker at the American Cancer Society--Relay 
for Life where she spoke about her successful battle with Hodgkin 
lymphoma. She is also a proud wife, mother, and grandmother.
   Mr. Speaker, for her committed service to the Benevolent and 
Protective Order of the Elks, I commend Maria Pedriani and congratulate 
her for being named the Hazleton Lodge #200 ``2013-2014 Elk of the 
Year.''</speaking>
