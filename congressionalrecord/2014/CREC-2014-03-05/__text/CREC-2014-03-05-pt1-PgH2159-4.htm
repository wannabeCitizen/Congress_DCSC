                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of March being 
Women's History Month. I rise today to say thank you for all the 
services for the women in the Third Congressional District and to the 
102 women who serve in the 113th Congress in the House and the Senate.
  I rise because we know when women succeed, America succeeds. I ask 
you to join me in making 2014 a year of action by having equal pay for 
equal work, providing affordable child care and access to health care.
  This afternoon, I am honored to join Swin Cash, a two-time Olympic 
gold medalist, as we initiate the Let's Move! initiative in honor of 
the First Lady's Let's Move! So to America, I say let's do this thing 
in honor of women.
