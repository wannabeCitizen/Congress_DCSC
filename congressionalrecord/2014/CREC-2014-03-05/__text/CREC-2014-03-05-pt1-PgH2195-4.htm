                       HONORING HENRY WILLIS NEAL

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is with heavy heart but a joy for 
his life that I rise today to honor Henry Willis ``Hanq'' Neal of 
Houston, Texas, who lost his battle in life last week. He was the music 
minister at the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church, an awesome tenor voice 
anointed by God.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Henry Willis ``Hanq'' Neal, the 
legendary minister of music at Houston's Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church, 
who was called home by the Lord on Thursday, February 27, 2014. He was 
57 years old.
  The attack that took his life occurred the Sunday preceding, after a 
number of church services where he led the music ministry, and then 
concluding at another church a few miles away, never stopping, never 
ceasing to lead to the glory the Lord.
  Hanq Neal possessed a distinctive singing voice that enthralled all 
audiences, the churched and the unchurched. According to the Reverend 
Marcus D. Cosby, Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church's senior pastor, because 
of Hanq, people's lives have been comforted and we have been enriched 
by his musical genius.
  Hanq Neal was born on September 4, 1956, one of eight children. He 
was raised in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, where he began to play the organ at 4 
and took up the violin at 7. He performed in school orchestras and sang 
in the church on Sunday. He dreamed of becoming a teacher, a gifted 
musician, and vocalist.
  Hanq Neal and two church friends formed a gospel trio, the 
Pentecostal Ambassadors. The group was discovered at a Gospel Music 
Workshop of America conference and signed to a recording contract by 
the gospel legend, Reverend James Cleveland.
  Hanq Neal sang the lead on ``If You Move Yourself,'' the title track 
of the 1980 gospel album recorded live in Detroit by the Donald Vails 
Choraleers.
  The main thing that I want to share with all of you is that Hanq Neal 
was a friend. He sang at Erica Lee's, my daughter's wedding. And he 
sang this song, Mr. Speaker, for the late Congressman Mickey Leland, 
``There Is Hope.''
  Hanq Neal gave hope to the world. We loved Hanq Neal. He was a hero, 
an American hero. We have lost a unique talent. We wish our deepest 
sympathy to his family, and he will be missed. You may not know him, 
Congress, but he is an American hero.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Henry Willis `Hanq' Neal, the 
legendary Minister of Music at Houston's Wheeler Baptist Church, who 
was called home by the Lord on Thursday, February 27, 2014. He was 57 
years old.
  Hanq Neal possessed a distinctive singing voice that enthralled all 
audiences, the churched and unchurched. According to the Rev. Marcus D. 
Cosby, Wheeler Baptist Church's senior pastor, because of Hanq, 
``people's lives have been comforted and we have been enriched by a 
musical genius.''
  Hanq Neal was born September 4, 1956, one of eight children. He was 
raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he began playing the organ at 4 
and took up the violin at 7. He performed in school orchestras and sang 
in church on Sunday. He dreamed of becoming a teacher.
  A gifted musician and vocalist, Hanq Neal and two church friends 
formed a gospel trio, the Pentecostal Ambassadors. The group was 
discovered at a Gospel Music Workshop of America conference and signed 
to a recording contract by gospel legend, Rev. James Cleveland.
  Hanq Neal sang the lead on ``If You Move Yourself,'' the title track 
of the 1980 gospel album recorded live in Detroit by The Donald Vails 
Choraleers.
  In 1984, Hanq joined the Windsor Village United Methodist Church, a 
small-but-growing Houston congregation, and eventually established five 
choirs with a total membership of 600. He served there until 2001 and 
helped Windsor become the denomination's largest congregation.

  Hanq Neal ``had an awesome tenor voice anointed by God,'' according 
to Kathy Taylor, the nationally known gospel artist who succeeded him 
as Windsor Village's music minister.
  Mr. Speaker, Hanq Neal was the preferred vocalist for Houston public 
occasions. He performed at mayoral inaugurations and for Queen 
Elizabeth II when she visited the city in 1991.
  It was at the memorial service for the late Congressman Mickey Leland 
in 1989 that Hanq Neal gained national recognition and critical acclaim 
for his rendition of ``There Is Hope,'' which became one of his 
signature songs.
  When Hanq finished that song there were no dry eyes in the room every 
heart was lifted.
  Hanq Neal's operatic rendition of ``The Lord's Prayer'' made him a 
popular soloist at funerals and other solemn occasions.
  Hanq Neal was a unique talent and an American original. He was 
genuine. He broke and crossed barriers. His music brought the church to 
the community and the community to the church.
  Mr. Speaker, Hanq Neal was a great man who touched the lives of all 
who heard him. He will be missed but never forgotten.
  I ask a moment of silence in memory of Henry Willis `Hanq' Neal.
