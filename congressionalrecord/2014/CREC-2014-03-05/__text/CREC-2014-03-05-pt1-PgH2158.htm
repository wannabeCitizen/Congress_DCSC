                     DEEPENING THE SAVANNAH HARBOR

  (Mr. BARROW of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BARROW of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in great disappointment 
that the President's budget makes no provision for deepening the 
Savannah harbor.
  The Port of Savannah is one of the busiest in the country and is a 
major throughway for all sorts of essential goods coming in and out of 
the country. The State of Georgia has collaborated with the Federal 
Government to ensure that the port is deepened to accommodate the 
larger ships that will soon come through the expanded Panama Canal.
  After decades of study, State and local stakeholders, congressional 
authorizers and appropriators, the Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, and the EPA have all endorsed this project as 
technically feasible, economically justified, cost-effective, 
environmentally responsible, and in the national interest.
  Vice President Biden recently visited Savannah and promised we would 
get this project done, ``come hell or high water.'' Only OMB now stands 
in the way.
  This project makes sense to almost everyone who has studied it. I 
share the frustration of my constituents that it continues to be 
stalled by bureaucracy, and I urge the President to lead, follow, or 
get out of the way of the effort to make this project happen.
