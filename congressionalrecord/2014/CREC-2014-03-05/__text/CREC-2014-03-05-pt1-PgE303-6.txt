  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, on March 4, 2014, I was unavoidably 
detained attending to representational activities in my congressional 
district and thus unable to return in time for rollcall votes No. 91 
and 92.
  Had I been present I would have voted as follows: On rollcall No. 91, 
I would have voted ``aye'' (March 4) (H.R. 3370, Homeowner Flood 
Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 (Rep. Grimm--Financial Services)); 
On rollcall No. 92, I would have voted ``aye'' (March 4) (H. Res. 488, 
Supporting the people of Venezuela as they protest peacefully for 
democratic change and calling to end the violence (Rep. Ros-Lehtinen--
Foreign Affairs)).
