                      SIMMONS COLLEGE OF KENTUCKY

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the oldest 
educational institutions in my home State of Kentucky. Recently, the 
Simmons College of Kentucky announced its accreditation from the 
Association of Biblical Higher Learning. It is the college's first 
national accreditation.
  The story of Simmons College is one of success. After the Civil War 
came to an end in 1865, there was no place in my home State where 
African Americans could obtain a college degree. That changed in 1879 
when the Kentucky Normal Theological Institute opened its doors on the 
corner of 8th and Kentucky Street in Louisville. The school's second 
president, Dr. W.J. Simmons, transformed the nascent school into a 
full-fledged university that offered a wide array of liberal arts and 
theological programs. Simmons increased the school's enrollment from 13 
to over 200 during his 10-year tenure. In 1918, Charles Parrish assumed 
the role of president of the university and aptly renamed the school 
Simmons University.
  Simmons flourished into the 1920s, when enrollment peaked at over 500 
students, but this success could not

shield the school from the devastation that sprang out of the Great 
Depression. The school was forced to sell its property in 1930 and 
drastically scale back its academic offerings. Simmons was down, but in 
no way, shape, or form was it out. In 1935 its leaders obtained a new 
location at 1811 Dumesnil Street. At this location, Simmons continued 
to provide Christian education, and in 1982 the school was renamed 
Simmons Bible College in order to reflect this focused mission.
  In 2007 the school, now bearing its current name of ``Simmons College 
of Kentucky,'' returned to its old location at the corner of 8th and 
Kentucky. The property was purchased in 2005 by the Reverend Dr. Kevin 
W. Cosby--himself the grandson of a Simmons College alumnus. Dr. 
Cosby's immense respect for the history and mission of the school led 
him to launch a campaign to return Simmons to its original location. 
Dr. Cosby also took on the role of president of the university and 
worked to once again expand Simmons's educational offerings.
  Dr. Cosby was helped in this endeavor by University of Louisville 
president James Ramsey. The two developed a friendship, and in 2010 
they signed an agreement that made it easier to transfer credits 
between the schools. President Ramsey called the deal ``historic'' as 
well as a ``testament to Reverend Cosby's persistence in seeking 
partnerships and opportunities for the less fortunate.''
  Simmons's recent accreditation by the Association for Biblical Higher 
Education is another enormous step forward for this venerable 
institution. The school continues to fulfill its mission of producing 
``productive citizens and agents of change in society.''
  Accreditation inherently brings increased credibility and prestige to 
the university, but it also provides more tangible benefits. With this 
formal recognition, Simmons is now eligible to receive government 
subsidies designated for historical Black colleges and universities. 
This money, coupled with a $2-million private donation from the Gheens 
Foundation, will undoubtedly lead to even brighter days ahead for 
Simmons College. Cole states that the university has plans to increase 
their enrollment from 130 to 350 students, as well as expand the range 
of programs offered.
  Through thick and thin, Simmons has weathered the storms of history 
to arrive at this moment stronger than ever. President Cosby believes 
that the school's past trials mustn't be forgotten but, rather, 
harnessed as source of strength to spur on future successes. I extend 
my gratitude and congratulations to the president of Simmons College, 
the Reverend Dr. Kevin W. Cosby, for his extraordinary success in 
leading the renaissance of this historic school.
  Simmons College is a truly remarkable institution, and their recent 
accreditation serves as testament to its perseverance and the good it 
continues to accomplish today. I ask that my Senate colleagues join me 
in honoring President Cosby and this admirable school.
