                       HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career and 
contributions of Mr. L. Tom Bulla, upon the occasion of his receipt of 
the Shepherd Center of Greenbrier Valley's Community Service Award. Mr. 
Bulla's work ethic and volunteer spirit are truly deserving of this 
award, as he has proudly served communities, both in his professional 
and private life.
  Tom began his career in 1962 and worked diligently to build a solid 
reputation as a credible leader in the North Carolina and Virginia 
banking communities. In 1981, he was hired as president, CEO, and 
director of Huntington Trust and Savings Bank in West Virginia. In 
1985, Tom oversaw the successful merger of Huntington Trust with the 
First Huntington National Bank. Shortly thereafter, his services were 
requested at Charleston National Bank, where he would serve as 
president and CEO, and again direct the merger of two West Virginia 
banks; Charleston National with Bank One, in 1993. A year later, Tom 
accepted a position as president, CEO, and director of First National 
Bankshares Corporation and The First National Bank in Ronceverte, West 
Virginia. Tom was very active in the West Virginia Bankers' 
Association, serving both on its Board of Directors and as its Chairman 
from 1996 through 1997. Additionally, Tom was selected by his 
colleagues to serve on the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh's Board 
of Directors from 1997 until 2000.
  Tom's career shepherded him into public service with an appointment 
from Governor Joe Manchin as the state's first Secretary of Commerce, 
where he successfully managed the consolidation of seven government 
agencies.
  As impressive as Tom's achievements in banking and the public sector 
have been, his contributions to our communities are equally impactful. 
Tom dedicated his time and energy to numerous nonprofit agencies 
including the Clay Center for the Arts and Sciences, Tamarack 
Foundation, United Way of West Virginia, Hospice, Charleston Area 
Medical Center, and the American Cancer Society. He served on the 
Lewisburg Building Commission, West Virginia Education Fund, YMCA 
Spirit of the Valley, and the West Virginia Economic Development 
Authority, along with a host of other valuable community and state 
organizations. And lastly, the Shepherd Center of the Greenbrier 
Valley, who is honoring him with its Community Service Award for Tom's 
fulfillment of its three tenets: lifelong learning, service to others, 
and spiritual growth.
  Tom Bulla resides in Lewisburg, West Virginia with his wife, Nancy. 
Known affectionately as ``Papa'' or ``Papa T'' by his grandchildren, 
Tom enjoys spending time with his extended family and his lifelong 
love: automobiles.
  Mr. Speaker, the State of West Virginia, our communities, and indeed, 
the United States of America owe Tom Bulla a debt of gratitude for his 
many years of distinguished service in his professional and personal 
life. I am honored to call him a friend and fellow West Virginian.
