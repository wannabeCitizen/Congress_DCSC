                    ALL-OF-THE-ABOVE ENERGY STRATEGY

  (Mr. BOEHNER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker and my colleagues, I know the whole House 
is paying close attention to the crisis in Ukraine. What is going on 
there is more than a cause for concern. It is a cause for action. 
America has a responsibility to stand up for freedom around the globe, 
and the House will work with the administration to support the 
Ukrainian people and confront Russian aggression.
  In fact, the House has already taken serious steps in this regard. 
For years, we have been pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy. 
It is part of our focus on the floor this week, in fact. Because 
developing our own resources doesn't just bring jobs home, it 
strengthens America abroad.
  Last month, the Energy and Commerce Committee released a report that 
says:

       By becoming a natural gas exporter, the U.S. can supplant 
     the influence of other exporters, like Russia and Iran, while 
     strengthening ties with our allies and trading partners 
     around the world.

  The key word in that statement is ``can.'' We can supplant Russia's 
influence, but we won't, so long as we have to contend with the Energy 
Department's achingly slow approval process.
  As we speak, the administration is sitting on 24 applications for 
natural gas exports. It has approved just six in the last 3 years. Now, 
this amounts to a de facto ban that only emboldens Vladimir Putin, 
allowing him to sell large quantities of natural gas to our allies.
  The American people have seen the threat that Mr. Putin puts forward. 
They know something must be done. The President should do the right 
thing here and end this de facto ban, so that we can strengthen both 
our economy and our security here and abroad.
