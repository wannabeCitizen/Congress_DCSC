         PAYING TRIBUTE TO CLYDE HOWELL OF RICHVALE, CALIFORNIA

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and ask this House 
to adjourn in the memory of a dear friend from Richvale, California, 
Clyde Howell, who passed away on January 29. He was a longtime 
community leader.
  Early in his life, he served in our United States Air Force in World 
War II. Clyde was born in Chesterfield, Idaho, later moving to 
Kingsburg in Central Valley, California.
  What Clyde would want to be known most for, though, is not just 
saving our country in World War II, but also saving souls. He dedicated 
most of his life in his church and in his community to helping people 
know about God. That is what Clyde would want us to know.
  Clyde was dearly loved by the community. He had a way to reach 
everybody, including youth. Even though he was a guy in his eighties, 
he had a way of talking to the young folks with that wry, crooked smile 
and the twinkle in his eye and a little tap on the shoulder. He had a 
way of connecting with people that was unique and certainly enjoyed and 
loved by his community.
  He is survived by many, many family members, and we will all miss him 
in the community.
