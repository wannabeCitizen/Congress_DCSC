 THE IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO THE 
                           CONFLICT IN SYRIA

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. ALBIO SIRES

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, this month marks the 3 year anniversary of 
the conflict in Syria. This conflict is destabilizing the region and 
has created the largest humanitarian crises we have ever seen. Over 
100,000 people have already been killed and 9 million people are 
currently in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. 3 million 
people are in hard to reach areas and over 250,000 people have been cut 
off from assistance for over a year. The UN has characterized the 
situation as ``dramatic beyond description.'' There have already been 
multiple failed attempts at peace-talks and cease-fires. The 
international community and Syrian forces must come together to find a 
long over-due peaceful agreement and end these inhumane and 
debilitating acts of violence.
  As we celebrate International Women's Day on March 8th, 2014, there 
is no better time to recognize the role of women in these protracted 
conflicts. They are not just the victims of violence; they are the 
resilient leaders working tirelessly to keep their families safe. Women 
leaders, who are pushing for peace can help further peace negotiations, 
understand a country's needs for an inclusive transition process and 
put Syrians on a path to reconciliation.
  While we continue to search for solutions, the United States joined 
by the rest of the world must do all it can to have an inclusive peace 
process that alleviates the tremendous amount of suffering being 
inflicted on Syria's civilian population.
