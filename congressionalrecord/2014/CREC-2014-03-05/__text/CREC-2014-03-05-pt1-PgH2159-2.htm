                     THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET REQUEST

  (Mr. MORAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the President submitted a very 
modest but responsible budget request. It contains a host of very good 
ideas that should move this country forward and that this Congress 
ought to embrace. For example, on both sides of the aisle, we agree 
that we ought to eliminate the waste of resources. But the greatest 
waste of resources is the waste of human potential, and it starts in 
the earliest years.
  So the President would extend access to prekindergarten education for 
all of our children, because he knows that that will enable us to have 
a far more prosperous economy and a more cohesive society, and he would 
pay for it with revenue from tobacco taxes--a great idea.
  Similarly, he would take the $4 billion in subsidies we give the oil 
and gas industry and invest it in new and cleaner alternative energy. 
He would take $300 billion and invest it in surface infrastructure. I 
was just over in Uzbekistan this month. They have a faster, more modern 
rail system than we do, as does China.
  Those are the kinds of good ideas that can move this country forward 
that this Congress should embrace.
