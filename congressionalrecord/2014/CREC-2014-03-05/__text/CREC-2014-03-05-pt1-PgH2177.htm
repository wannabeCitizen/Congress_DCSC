  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speakers, had I been present for rollcall vote 98 on

much-needed energy savings measures.


                          Personal Explanation

  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, on March 5, 2014--I was not 
present for rollcall votes 93-98 due to an event in Connecticut with 
President Barack Obama. If I had been present for these votes, I would 
have voted: ``nay'' on rollcall vote 93, ``nay'' on rollcall vote 94, 
``aye'' on rollcall vote 95, ``aye'' on rollcall vote 96, ``nay'' on 
rollcall vote 97, ``aye'' on rollcall vote 98.


                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on rollcall vote Nos. 96, 97, 
and 98, I was not present because of a dental emergency. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ``yea'' for rollcall vote No. 96, ``nay'' 
on rollcall vote No. 97, and ``yea'' on rollcall vote No. 98.
