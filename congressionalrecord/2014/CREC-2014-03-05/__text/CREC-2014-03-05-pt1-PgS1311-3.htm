                      COOK INLET HOUSING AUTHORITY

<bullet> Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, in 2014, Cook Inlet Housing 
Authority celebrates its 40th anniversary of building housing 
opportunities for the people of the Cook Inlet region of Southcentral 
Alaska.
  In 1974, the Alaska State Legislature facilitated the creation of 
Cook Inlet Housing to ensure elders, individuals, and families in the 
Cook Inlet region would have access to quality, affordable housing. 
Since that time, Cook Inlet Housing has developed more than 1,500 
energy-efficient and affordable homes for seniors and families and has 
catalyzed the revitalization of the Mountain View neighborhood in 
Anchorage.
  The passage of Native American Housing Assistance and Self 
Determination Act by the U.S. Congress in 1996, and the flexibility 
allowed within it, has empowered Cook Inlet Housing to leverage funding 
from private and public sources and more than doubled the amount of 
quality, affordable housing available to families in Southcentral 
Alaska.
  This year, Cook Inlet Housing is being recognized nationally with the 
prestigious HUD and American Planning Association's 2014 HUD 
Secretary's Opportunity and Empowerment Award. This award honors 
excellence in community planning resulting in measureable benefits in 
terms of increased economic development, employment, education, or 
housing choice and mobility for low- and moderate-income residents. I 
know the work that Cook Inlet Housing is doing for our community 
matters and helps transform lives.
  I would like to congratulate Cook Inlet Housing Authority for their 
commitment to innovation and thoughtful, dynamic development that 
promotes their critical mission: To create housing opportunities that 
empower people and build communities.<bullet>
