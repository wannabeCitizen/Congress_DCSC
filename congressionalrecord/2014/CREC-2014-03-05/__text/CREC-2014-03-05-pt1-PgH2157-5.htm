                        REMEMBERING DR. DON WILL

  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay 
tribute to a true champion for education, Donald Will, who passed away 
this past February. Dr. Donald Will was a fervent advocate of peace and 
influenced Chapman University's role in promoting peace and the study 
of peacemaking.
  A member of the Chapman faculty since 1987, Don was described as a 
pillar of the Chapman community for over 25 years. He came to Chapman 
University when it needed his expertise most, and the world needed his 
peace expertise, and he has had such a magnificent effect that lasts 
until now.
  During his time with Chapman, Dr. Will put all of his heart and time 
from his academic and personal life into carrying out the pursuit of 
peace. And don't we need it today in our world?
  His commitment to his students and to the value of peaceful relations 
shone brightly through his teachings. He leaves a lasting legacy of 
humility, humanity, and dedication as he strengthened the link between 
school and home, both locally, nationally, and in an international way.
  I am honored to have known and to have worked with Dr. Donald Will, 
and I ask my colleagues to honor him today.
