               HONORING THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM GUSTE, JR.

  (Mr. RICHMOND asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a true 
statesman who was a guiding light for Louisiana for many years. I am 
talking about former Louisiana Attorney General William ``Billy'' 
Guste.
  Attorney General Guste passed away last summer, but I wanted to take 
a moment to discuss his impact on my home State and discuss who he was 
as a man because he represents what was best about Louisiana.
  You see, Mr. Speaker, he was a fighter. He fought for what was right. 
He fought for average Louisiana citizens. He fought tooth and nail for 
environmental justice, for racial fairness, for coastal restoration, 
for affordable housing, and for the homeless. During his 20 years of 
service as attorney general, he was always trying to fight for things 
that he believed would help ordinary, average people.
  We should remember this lesson, Mr. Speaker, so that we remember that 
our

fights should mean something. We should fight to improve the lives of 
our constituents, not to win political battles.
  Growing up in Louisiana, I am a direct beneficiary of Billy Guste's 
courage to do what was truly right and truly compassionate. In that 
tradition, Mr. Speaker, I say we must honor Mr. Guste's legacy by doing 
the same.
