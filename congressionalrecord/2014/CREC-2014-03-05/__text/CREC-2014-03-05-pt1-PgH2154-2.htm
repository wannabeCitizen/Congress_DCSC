                      SUPPORTING UKRAINE'S FUTURE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) for 5 minutes.

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in continued support of the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation of Ukraine and 
stand with the people of that country for their liberty and full human 
rights.
  The first objective of international efforts to calm Ukraine must be 
the overriding goal of no more bloodshed. The world community of 
nations must step up forcefully to affirm Ukraine's new government, and 
not just for the sake of tomorrow.
  Morally, nations that had supported Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin or 
were bystanders to communism and Naziism that slaughtered millions and 
millions of people inside those borders owe Ukraine an historical debt. 
No place on Earth suffered more. As the demonstrators on Maidan have 
proven, tyrants and corrupt officials couldn't kill Ukraine's people's 
longing for freedom and liberty.
  This is Ukraine's moment, and it is a breakpoint in liberty's march 
that history will judge.
  Where do we go from here? Our path must be diplomatic, economic, 
humanitarian, and military. Diplomatically, the international community 
must affirm Ukraine and her interim government. I commend President 
Obama and Secretary Kerry for their leadership. Yesterday, the OSCE 
announced that 18 participating countries will send 35 unarmed military 
observers to Ukraine. Let them reveal the truth.
  Countries with large Ukrainian diaspora, like our country, along with 
Poland, Canada, Argentina, Italy, Portugal, Australia, the United 
Kingdom, and Kazakhstan, should seek constructive means to help.
  Further, the world community and OSCE should assure sufficient 
election monitors are recruited and trained for the upcoming elections 
in Ukraine on May 25. Then, economically, the world community should 
proceed to work through Ukraine's financial challenges. However, any 
financial assistance to Ukraine should be contingent on repayment, and 
Ukraine's new government must clearly define performance standards and 
lay out a reasonable plan to repay any foreign aid.
  Transitioning from a kleptocracy to a functioning state will require 
technical assistance, management expertise, and loaned personnel from 
governments throughout the world. In addition, the United States and 
other nations should impose targeted financial, economic, trade, and 
travel sanctions on Russian assets on a timetable that demonstrates our 
resolve.
  The United Nations and global supporters of Ukraine must respond if 
Ukraine requests humanitarian relief to those places most in need. As 
long as Russian aggression persists, its participation in the G8 should 
be suspended. And, finally, militarily, the parties to the 1994 
Budapest accords should enforce that agreement.
  In addition, Ukraine exists in an inferior military posture to its 
more powerful neighboring states. To remedy this shortcoming, NATO 
should create a new category of provisional membership for nations 
whose military has fought alongside NATO member forces in the war on 
terrorism. Ukraine has.
  As a true borderland region, Ukraine is positioned to be truly a 
bridge between East, West, North, and South in that most important 
region of Central Europe. The free world must walk with Ukraine as she 
moves toward a more free and democratic future. There is no turning 
back.
