               IN THE COMPANY OF WOMEN ANNUAL CELEBRATION

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I 
recognize the hardworking women leaders who, throughout the years, have 
made instrumental contributions to the district I so humbly represent 
and to our entire south Florida community, in fact.
  On March 13, the Miami-Dade County Commission for Women, the Parks 
Foundation of Miami-Dade, and the Miami-Dade Parks, Recreation and Open 
Spaces Department will be hosting the In the Company of Women Awards in 
celebration of Women's History Month. This annual celebration honors 
some of the exceptional women in our community in fields like the arts, 
communications, government, and athletics.
  The 12 honorees this year will join the ranks of many outstanding 
women, including my late mother, Amanda Ros, who was honored during 
their third annual In the Company of Women celebration. As a fellow 
recipient of this award also, I am pleased that the great passion and 
dedication of these women leaders will be recognized, and it will 
inspire them to do even better work. Their many accomplishments are an 
example of what women everywhere can strive to attain.
  Congratulations to each award winner.
