 NOMINATION OF PAMELA L. REEVES TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR 
                   THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.
  The bill clerk read the nomination of Pamela L. Reeves, of Tennessee, 
to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District of 
Tennessee.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.
  Mr. REID. It is 4:45 p.m. We have a lot of votes. We can move through 
these votes very quickly. They are 10-minute votes. I have some 
complaints from some Senators that it is not fair to wait around for 
other Senators when there are a lot of things going on tonight. At the 
end of 15 minutes, no matter who is not here, we are going to cut off 
the votes. That is what everybody wants and that is what we are going 
to do.
  Anyway, we have to do that. If it is a close vote, then we always 
give time for people to play around with that, but these votes haven't 
been that close and so I think we should get through these votes as 
quickly as we can. I am alerting everyone and the floor staff.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the postcloture time 
is yielded back.
  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination 
of Pamela L. Reeves, of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge 
for the Eastern District of Tennessee.
  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?
  There appears to be a sufficient second.
  The bill clerk called the roll.
  Mr. THUNE. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator 
from Texas (Mr. Cornyn).
  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) 
would have voted ``yea.''
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber 
desiring to vote?
  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 0, as follows:

                       [Rollcall Vote No. 52 Ex.]
