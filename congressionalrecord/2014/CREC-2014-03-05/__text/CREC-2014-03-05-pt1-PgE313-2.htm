  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 
Minority Business Development Agency, MBDA, on its 45th anniversary and 
commend its commitment and success in promoting the growth and 
competitiveness of a critical segment of the U.S. economy, the minority 
business community. For the past 45 years, the MBDA has provided an 
essential service to this nation, working to level the playing field 
for minority-owned businesses.
  The results speak for themselves. At the time of MBDA's creation 
there were only 322,000 minority-owned firms in the nation. Today, the 
number stands at 5.8 million; 215,000 of which are in the City of 
Houston. Over the last five years in particular, the MBDA has assisted 
firms gain access to over $19 billion in contracts and capital 
resulting in the creation and retention of nearly 60,000 jobs.
  Today, the MBDA is celebrating this day in my district by launching a 
new MBDA Business Center at Houston Community College, which was 
awarded a three-year $900,000 grant to operate the MBDA Business 
Center. HCC's MBDA Business Center will help boost job creation and 
global competitiveness of minority-owned businesses across the nation. 
I look forward to continuing to work with MBDA and Houston Community 
College to create jobs locally so that we may thrive globally.
  Congratulations, MBDA, on 45 years of great work. May the next 45 
years be even better.

                          ____________________
