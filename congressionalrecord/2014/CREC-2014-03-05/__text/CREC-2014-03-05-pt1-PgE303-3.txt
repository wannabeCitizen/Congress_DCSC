                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
90th anniversary of the Orlando Museum of Art. Since its founding, the 
Museum has remained committed to enriching the cultural life of Florida 
and developing inclusive programs that serve every segment of a diverse 
community.
   In 1924, the Orlando Museum of Art began as a small group of artists 
who met informally to display and discuss their work. They formed the 
Orlando Art Association, teaching art classes and arranging exhibits. 
In 1987, the name was officially changed to the Orlando Museum of Art, 
and within two years, it was acclaimed as one of the best in the 
region. The Museum features a dynamic set of collections ranging from 
contemporary art to Golden Age masterpieces and has hosted various 
high-profile exhibits.
   The Museum has maintained its national accredited status by the 
American Association of Museums without interruption for over 40 years 
and continues to provide excellence in the visual arts. I thank the 
Orlando Museum of Art for its ongoing dedication to advancing the arts 
in our community.
