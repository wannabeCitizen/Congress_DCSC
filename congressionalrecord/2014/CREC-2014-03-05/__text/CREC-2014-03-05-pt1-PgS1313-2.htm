                 CENTRAL LOUISIANA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

<bullet> Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Central 
Louisiana Chamber of Commerce.
  The Central Louisiana Chamber of Commerce was originally founded as 
the Alexandria Chamber of Commerce by 250 men from all walks of life on 
March 30, 1914, in the Italian Room of the Hotel Bentley. Their intent 
was to promote the city and the region in order to attract business and 
facilitate growth, and they have been continuing this work for 100 
years.
  Over the next few decades, the Alexandria chamber would see many 
accomplishments toward this goal, with railroad companies like Missouri 
Pacific and Texas and Pacific opening terminal and repair facilities. 
Likewise, in 1923 RoyOMartin would open a forestry and wood products 
manufacturing facility. The U.S. military established a presence with 
Camp Beauregard, and the Alexandra VA Hospital opened to train and care 
for our men during World Wars I and II. Fort Polk was opened in 1941 to 
support our engagement in World War II, and the Fort Polk and the Joint 
Readiness Training Center continues to train men and women defending 
the United States today.
  In 1956, the Alexandria chamber would merge with its neighboring 
chamber in Pineville, LA, to establish the Greater Alexandria-Pineville 
Chamber of Commerce to expand economic development initiatives across 
the region. During the next 30 years, LSU opened a campus in 
Alexandria; commercial airlines offered flights from Esler Field; and 
companies such as Proctor & Gamble and Manning, Maxwell & Moore opened 
manufacturing plants, all in part due to the efforts of Greater 
Alexandria-Pineville Chamber.
  In 1986, the chamber would adopt its current name, with a mission and 
vision to advocate for pro-business policies and provide programs that 
foster an environment for economic growth across the 11 parish region 
that it now represents, leveraging partnerships with many other 
organizations in the area to promote the region. The central Louisiana 
chamber has also prioritized helping young people in the community. The 
Chamber's Young Professionals Group is one such example of efforts to 
engage, retain, and involve Louisiana's future leaders. Also, its Work 
Ready Network is a partnership with the Rapides Foundation, the Orchard 
Foundation, and the Central Louisiana Economic Development Alliance to 
link education, workforce development efforts, and the region's 
economic needs.
  Since its founding the Central Louisiana Chamber of Commerce has gone 
on to become the largest chamber in the region with more than 1,100 
member businesses representing more than 28,000 employees. The chamber 
been an economic, social, and political leader for central Louisiana, 
and I am pleased to congratulate them on a century of success.<bullet>
