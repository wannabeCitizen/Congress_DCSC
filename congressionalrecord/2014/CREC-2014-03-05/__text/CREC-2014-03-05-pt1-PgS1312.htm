                          TRIBUTE TO ANN WAYT

<bullet> Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, when we think of those who provide 
treatment to our loved ones, we think of registered nurses like Ann 
Wayt--a long-time staff member of Affinity Medical Center in Massillon, 
OH. Ms. Wayt has earned both the Affinity Medical Center Nurse 
Excellence Award and the esteemed Cameos of Caring award from the 
University of Akron's College of Nursing. Patients and fellow nurses in 
the hospital's orthopedic unit, were touched daily by Ms. Wayt's 
professionalism and care. Several of Ms. Wayt's coworkers have referred 
to her as a role model.
  It does not come as a surprise that a nurse who cares so much about 
her patients also cares about her fellow workers and their working 
conditions. Collective bargaining in health care isn't just about a 
paycheck. It is about staffing levels, patient safety, and ensuring 
health care quality. For years, joining a union was a ticket to the 
middle class and ensured that those who work hard and take 
responsibility can still get ahead.
  However, on September 26, 2012, Ann was fired by Community Health 
Systems, the hospital's parent company, shortly after she rallied with 
co-workers to organize a collective voice for better, safer workplace 
conditions and patient care. In fact, Ms. Wayt was fired by the 
hospital the day before the nurses voted to form a collective 
bargaining unit. Though other grounds were given, both the National 
Labor Relations Board, NLRB, and the Federal Court ruled Ms. Wayt was 
fired because she was a lead organizer for her fellow nurses.
  We have seen too many attacks on workers' rights in recent years. We 
have seen too many efforts to hamstring the NLRB and its ability to 
protect the rights of workers, and we have seen too many people fired 
for engaging in collective activity.
  Fortunately, the NLRB stepped in and held a hearing last year, and 
the findings speak for themselves: Community Health Systems was ordered 
to reinstate Ms. Wayt and to recognize the nurses' union. Community 
Health Systems refused to comply.
  In January 2014, Federal Judge John Adams ordered Ann's 
reinstatement, the recognition of the nurses' collective bargaining 
unit and for the hospital to stop harassing the nurses because they 
want a voice at work.
  Nurses are on the front lines of patient care and deserve to have 
their voices heard on important, common sense issues such as:
  Minimum staffing levels based on patient acuity;
  the right to refuse unsafe assignments;
  the right to advocate for patients; and
  lift equipment safety protections for RNs and patients.
  A 2013 study by the American Nurses Association shows that when 
workplaces collaborate and listen to worker input, nurses are able to 
provide care more effectively, and hospitals gain better overall 
patient outcomes.
  Welcome back, Ann, and congratulations.<bullet>
