  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, The American Dream is 
attainable with hard work and dedication. South Carolina is very 
fortunate to have devoted teachers who dedicated to helping every child 
succeed. This week, a group of teachers and students from Red Bank 
Elementary School in Lexington, South Carolina, are visiting Washington 
to see the government at work. I am very proud of this group of young 
people, as they are dedicated to achieving a bright future by 
participating in their school's Business Mentor Program.

  The Red Bank Elementary School Business Mentor Program engages 
children in learning by connecting them with local mentors affiliated 
with businesses in the Midlands community. Leaders from Michelin Tire 
Corporation, Lexington Medical Center, Prysmian Group, Riverbanks Zoo 
and Botanical Garden, and he South Carolina State Museum have impacted 
close to 150 students over the past three years. By connecting the 
skills each student learns in the classroom to a professional 
environment, these bright children are given the opportunity to chase 
their dreams.
  As a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I am 
encouraged by the opportunities these young students are able to enjoy 
and appreciate the business mentors for contributing to their future.
