        NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REGULATORY UTILITY COMMISSIONERS

<bullet> Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the 
milestone 125th anniversary of the National Association of Regulatory 
Utility Commissioners, the national association representing our 
Nation's State utility economic regulators.
  The work of our Nation's public utility regulators often goes 
unnoticed and unheralded until the lights go out or our utility rates 
increase. But, rest assured, the work these officials do on a daily 
basis impacts every single one of us in the country.
  State utility regulators ensure the rates we pay for utility services 
are fair, just, and reasonable. They help make sure the utilities 
deliver these services--electricity, natural gas, water, and 
telecommunications--in a safe and reliable manner.
  NARUC offers its members countless opportunities for education, 
sharing of best practices, advocacy, and much more. Since March of 
1889, the Association has provided countless resources aimed at 
improving regulatory practices. Since just about all of us pay utility 
bills in some way or another, we have all benefited from NARUC's work 
over the last century and a quarter.
  Think about it: in 1889, the electricity industry was in its infancy. 
Alexander Graham Bell was still perfecting his groundbreaking invention 
called the telephone. We were still learning how best to transport 
water and natural gas.
  What a difference 125 years makes. We can now electrify our homes 
from solar rooftops. We can carry our personal computers in our pockets 
on our smartphones. We are using new technologies to find abundant 
resources of natural gas.
  The one constant has been NARUC and the quality utility regulation it 
promotes. I thank NARUC and congratulate it on this 125th year 
anniversary.
  Congratulations NARUC!<bullet>
