   TO RESPOND TO RUSSIAN AGGRESSION, SELL U.S. NATURAL GAS TO UKRAINE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first, Vladimir Putin invaded Georgia. 
Now, the Russian bear is after Ukraine.
  Ukraine is almost totally dependent on Russia for energy. Russian 
imperialism has proven that it is willing to use gas as a political and 
economic weapon to intimidate its neighbors. Twice it turned off the 
fuel switch in Ukraine, and I was even in Ukraine the last time Putin 
turned off the gas during the winter. It was cold.
  Many other European nations are also at the mercy of the Kremlin when 
it comes to energy. We can help European countries who depend on 
imperialist Russia for energy by selling them natural gas from America. 
The demand is there, and the American supply is overwhelming. The only 
thing standing in the way are the bureaucrats in the Department of 
Energy.
  That is why today I am introducing legislation that would require the 
Department of Energy to expedite and approve permits to Ukraine, all 
former Soviet nations, and all members of the European Union.
  Let's eliminate Russia's natural gas monopoly. Let's respond to 
Russian aggression. Let's encourage the Europeans and former Soviet 
Republics to ``Buy American.''
  And that's just the way it is.
