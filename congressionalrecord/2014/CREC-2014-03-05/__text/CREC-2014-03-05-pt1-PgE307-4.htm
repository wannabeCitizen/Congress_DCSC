                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor an Olympic athlete 
from Washington State's 8th District, Mr. Torin Koos. Mr. Koos just 
returned from representing our nation in the XXII Olympic Winter Games 
in Sochi, Russia. Mr. Koos is an incredible athlete who has reached the 
pinnacle of his sport and competed in the Men's Sprint Free 
Qualification.
  I applaud both his achievement and the hard-work and perseverance 
that paid off during these games. Simply to attend the Olympics is to 
be among an elite group of people. I thank Mr. Koos for representing 
America so well, and I am proud to call him a constituent and a 
Washingtonian.
