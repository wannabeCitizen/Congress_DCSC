CONGRATULATIONS TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN ALABAMA's SEVENTH DISTRICT THAT 
             WON THE STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS IN 2014

  (Ms. SEWELL of Alabama asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to declare Alabama's 
Seventh Congressional District to be the district of high school 
basketball champions.
  This year, in 2014, at the State tournament held by the Alabama High 
School Athletic Association, teams from the Seventh Congressional 
District of Alabama dominated, winning four boys basketball State 
championship titles and one girls.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Class 1A boys 
basketball State champions, St. Jude Educational Institute of 
Montgomery, Alabama; Class 3A boys basketball State champions, Midfield 
High School of Midfield, Alabama; Class 4A boys basketball State 
champions, Dallas County High School of Plantersville, Alabama; Class 
5A boys basketball State champions, Parker High School of Birmingham; 
Class 5A girls basketball champions, Wenonah High School of Birmingham, 
Alabama.
  No doubt that in the Seventh Congressional District of Alabama we 
breed winners. I plan to provide individual remarks about each school's 
victory so that each school is recognized in the Congressional Record. 
For now, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me 
in congratulating and honoring the State of Alabama high school 
basketball champions from Alabama's Seventh Congressional District, the 
district of high school basketball champions.
