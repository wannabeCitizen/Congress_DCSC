                                 prayer

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Holy God, because of Your great love, we do not cringe or falter at 
the challenges our Nation faces, for You have never forsaken us in our 
hour of need. Lord, give our lawmakers a desire to seek Your wisdom and 
to follow You where You lead. May they claim Your promise that no 
weapon formed against us will prosper. Help them to not permit the 
world to squeeze them into its mold as they seek to be transformed by 
Your powerful presence. Thank You for our many freedoms and empower us 
to use them to bless others.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
