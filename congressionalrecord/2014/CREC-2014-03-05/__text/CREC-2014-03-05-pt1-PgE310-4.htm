  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent in the House 
chamber for votes on Tuesday, March 4, 2014.
  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall vote 91 in 
support of passage of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act 
of 2014.
  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall vote 92 in 
support of H. Res. 488 supporting the people of Venezuela. The 
Venezuelan people have the right to protest peacefully without fear of 
violence or intimidation.
