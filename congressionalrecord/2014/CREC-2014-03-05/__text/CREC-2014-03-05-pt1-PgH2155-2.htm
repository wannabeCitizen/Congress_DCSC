HONORING DALLAS COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL, ALABAMA'S CLASS 4A STATE BASKETBALL 
                             CHAMPIONS 2014

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Alabama (Ms. Sewell) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the Dallas 
County High School Hornets on winning the State of Alabama title in the 
class 4A State basketball championship on Saturday, March 1, 2014. On 
behalf of the Seventh Congressional District, I pay honor and tribute 
to the Hornets for their exemplary athleticism and teamwork, as well as 
the outstanding leadership of Head Coach Willie Moore and his coaching 
staff.
  Dallas County High School's basketball championship victory capped 
off

an impressive season of 28 wins and 4 losses. With each victory during 
the season, the team remained humble and grounded. In every game, these 
young men and the coaching staff pursued excellence and were driven by 
hard work, determination, and teamwork.
  Throughout the season, Coach Willie Moore encouraged the team by 
quoting Whitney Young, Jr.:

       It is better to be prepared for an opportunity and not have 
     one than to have an opportunity and not be prepared.

  The Hornets finished the 2013-2014 season undefeated in their region 
and lost only four games overall. To earn their place in the 
championship title game, Dallas County beat other high school teams 
during the tournament, including Madison County, Dora, Bibb County, and 
Beauregard.

  On March 1, 2014, the Dallas County Hornets came to the 4A State 
Championship prepared for the opportunity they had earned. The 
championship game against J.O. Johnson High School from Huntsville, 
Alabama, was a nail-biter from start to finish. The Hornets never gave 
up, even when they were behind. At halftime, the Hornets were down by 
11 points, but in the third quarter, the Hornets made a thrilling 
comeback.
  Senior William Lee made a 3-pointer at the regulation buzzer to force 
the game into overtime. The 6'9" standout and UAB signee William Lee 
continued to show dominance during the overtime by making three crucial 
free throws with 5.4 seconds to play. The Hornets won a 51-48 victory, 
taking the Class 4A High School Boys State Championship. William Lee 
scored 22 points, made 13 rebounds and seven blocks.
  As the daughter of a high school basketball coach, I know that this 
decisive victory is the result of a tremendous effort on the part of 
all the players and the coaching staff at Dallas County High School. 
Spurred on by an enthusiastic student body and encouraging faculty and 
families, this team proved that outstanding achievements are possible 
even in rural Black Belt Alabama. I couldn't be prouder of this amazing 
accomplishment.
  The State high school basketball championship victory is truly a 
reflection of the hard work and steadfast determination of the entire 
team and coaching staff. Members of the team include Jayden Buford, 
Scott Cole, Raheem Phillips, Kendell Motley, Jerrod Moorer, Henry 
Baker, Timothy Baker, Travon Muse, Javaris Muse, B.J. Leshore, William 
Lee, Ladarius Furlow, and Lowell Furlow.
  I would like to also acknowledge and pay tribute to the head coach, 
Willie Moore, and assistant coaches, Cliff Nix, Charles Thompson, Kenny 
Allen, Justin Moore, and Hugh Martin for their outstanding work.
  On behalf of the Seventh Congressional District, the State of 
Alabama, and this Nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating 
the accomplishments of the Dallas County High School basketball team 
for their victory in Alabama's Class 4A State Basketball Championship. 
We honor and pay tribute to this team, the coaches and the school for 
this distinguished honor, and we appreciate their contributions to the 
school spirit and the community pride that we have in them.
  Congratulations, and go Hornets.
