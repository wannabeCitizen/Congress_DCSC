                  TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS COMPLEX RESEARCH

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, as a member of the Rare Disease 
Congressional Caucus, I rise today in support of continued funding for 
tuberous sclerosis complex research in the fiscal year 2015 Department 
of Defense Appropriations Act.
  TSC is a genetic condition that afflicts an estimated 50,000 
Americans,

causing tumors in the kidneys, lungs, liver, heart, eyes, skin, and 
brain. Researchers have linked TSC to seizures, autism, and severe 
intellectual disability.
  Research on this condition is also having a notable impact on our 
understanding of traumatic brain injury and other medical conditions, 
like cancer and diabetes.
  The TSC program at the Department of Defense is critical to our 
continued understanding of this condition.
  With me on the floor today, Mr. Speaker, is a beautiful little girl, 
Stephanie from Pennsylvania, who has been diagnosed with TSC.
  Her brave spirit brings light to the importance of this cause and 
helps remind us of others living with this condition across the United 
States.
  It is crucial that we continue to band together as a community and a 
legislative body to support this significant research initiative.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The Chair reminds Members 
not to refer to persons on the floor as guests of the House.
