           COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF POGROM AT SUMGAIT

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. LINDA T. SANCHEZ

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the anniversary of the pogrom that took place in Sumgait, 
Azerbaijan against people of Armenian descent. A pogrom is a violent 
riot aimed at massacre or persecution of an ethnic or religious group. 
On the evening of February 27, 1988 hundreds of Armenians were 
massacred in the seaside town of Sumgait in Soviet Azerbaijan. This 
violence against Armenians continued for three days and resulted in the 
reported killing of 32 people, with countless others that remain 
unaccounted for.
  It is my hope that by speaking out publicly against atrocities 
suffered by our brethren around the world, we will help reaffirm 
America's commitment to an enduring, peaceful and democratic 
resolution.
  I ask that my colleagues join me in solemnly commemorating the death 
of these innocent lives. My thoughts are with the Armenian community, 
especially those that lost loved ones during the pogrom at Sumgait 26 
years ago.
