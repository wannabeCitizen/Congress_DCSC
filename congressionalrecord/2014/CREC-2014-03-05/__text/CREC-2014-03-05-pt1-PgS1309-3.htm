                   TRIBUTE TO SHERIFF DOUG GILLESPIE

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to honor Sheriff Doug Gillespie, of 
the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, who was recently named 
the National Sheriffs' Association's 2014 Sheriff of the Year.
  The Ferris E. Lucas Award for Sheriff of the Year is awarded to 
recognize an outstanding sheriff for contributions made to improve the 
office of sheriff at the local, State, and national levels, and for 
involvement in the community above and beyond the responsibilities 
required. By this measure, I can think of no one more deserving than 
Sheriff Gillespie. His tireless service as sheriff has made the Las 
Vegas metropolitan area a safer and better place to live, work, and 
raise a family.
  Sheriff Gillespie has diligently served the Las Vegas community for 
33 years as a metropolitan police officer, the last 7 as sheriff. Under 
Sheriff Gillespie's leadership, metro has become one of only 72 
intelligence-gathering fusion centers in the country. It has won the 
Webber Seavey Award, given for quality in law enforcement by the 
International Association of Chiefs of Police, for an outreach effort 
to strengthen police relations in the Las Vegas area. Metro is also one 
of only 32 departments to achieve the highest standard of accreditation 
from the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.
  In addition to his position as sheriff, he has served in many 
leadership roles in other law enforcement organizations, such as board 
director of the National Sheriff's Association Executive Committee, 
chair of the Homeland Security Committee for the Major City Chiefs 
Association, vice chair of the Nevada High Intensity Drug Trafficking 
Area Task Force, finance committee chair for the Nevada Commission for 
Homeland Security, and president of the Major County Sheriff's 
Association.
  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I congratulate Sheriff Doug Gillespie 
on receiving the Ferris E. Lucas Award for Sheriff of the Year and look 
forward to the continuation of a career that has already made Nevada 
very proud.
