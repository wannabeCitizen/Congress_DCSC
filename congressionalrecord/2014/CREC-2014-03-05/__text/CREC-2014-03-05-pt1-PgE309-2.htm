    100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JASON T. SMITH

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th 
Anniversary of the National Cooperative Extension Service. The Smith-
Lever Act of 1914 created this educational partnership which began 
between the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the nation's land-grant 
universities. The Cooperative Extension Service grants state 
universities funds to produce significant research which is available 
for the use of the public across the nation. In addition, research 
based education programs have improved the lives of many through the 
advancements made in farming, business, health services, and emergency 
management.
  In the Show-Me State, the Missouri Extension Services have been 
fundamental to community development. Nearly seventy percent of 
Missouri's taxpayer funded research is produced by the land grant 
universities. This information is used to enhance vital industries like 
agriculture, business, and healthcare. The state of Missouri has 
benefitted immensely through the active role of the Extension programs 
which equip our communities with vital information and educational 
programs.
  For the advances made possible in Missouri and across the nation by 
the Cooperative Extension Service, it is my pleasure to recognize the 
100th Anniversary of the National Cooperative Extensions in the House 
of Representatives.
