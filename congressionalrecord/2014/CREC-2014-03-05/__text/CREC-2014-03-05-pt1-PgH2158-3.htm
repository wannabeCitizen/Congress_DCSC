                   JOHN BUHRMASTER'S ICBA NOMINATION

  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate John 
Buhrmaster, who is president of 1st National Bank of Scotia in the 
capital region of New York, upon his nomination as chairman of the 
Independent Community Bankers of America, here in Washington, D.C.
  The Independent Community Bankers of America represents almost 7,000 
community banks across our great Nation, financial institutions that 
provide opportunity for our local small businesses and family farms to 
expand operations, develop surrounding economies, and hire locally.
  John will provide steady leadership for an 11-person executive panel 
that draws expertise and know-how from across the Nation to support our 
small banks.
  Again, I congratulate Mr. Buhrmaster on his appointment, and I look 
forward to working with him to boost small financial institutions and 
their important role in economic expansion on a community level.

                          ____________________
