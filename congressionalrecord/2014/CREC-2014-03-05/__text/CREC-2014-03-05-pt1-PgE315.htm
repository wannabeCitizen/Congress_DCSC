                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my 
heartiest congratulations to Tech Molded Plastics Inc., a family-owned 
injection mold company, on being named Plastics News' Processor of the 
Year.
  Located in Meadville, Pennsylvania, Tech Molded Plastics celebrated 
its 40th year in business just last year. In 1973, Bill Hanaway and his 
wife Eva started their family business in a rented garage. Over the 
years, Tech Molded has expanded and diversified its business through 
smart investments in their people and technology. In the mid-1990s, 
Tech Molded erected the factory building that now houses its company 
headquarters. In 2011, the company expanded again by purchasing the 
building adjacent to it with an investment of more than $1.5 million. 
Today, sons Scott, Mark, and Doug still run the family business along 
with their mother, Eva, manufacturing precision parts for the 
electronics, automotive, and medical industry. Employing 120 
Pennsylvanians and generating sales of $17.7 million, Tech Molded 
Plastics embodies the best of America's family-owned small businesses.
  Mr. Speaker, in light of being awarded Processor of the Year, I ask 
that my colleagues join with me today in recognizing Tech Molded 
Plastics for its national leadership in the plastics industry and for 
the invaluable contributions of the Hanaway family to the citizens of 
Meadville and Western Pennsylvania.
