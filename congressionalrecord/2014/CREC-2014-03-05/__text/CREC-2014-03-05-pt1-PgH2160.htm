                HONORING SENATOR BOB DOLE AND HIS LEGACY

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a truly great Kansan, a 
Jayhawk, and an American hero who embodies every sense of the term 
``public servant.''
  Senator Bob Dole has spent his life as a servant to the American 
people: as a soldier wounded in combat during World War II; he served 
as a Member of this House, the Senate, and ran for President.
  We in Kansas are so very proud of Senator Dole's legacy as our native 
son. Ten years ago, the University of Kansas, my alma mater, completed 
construction and opened to the public the Robert J. Dole Institute of 
Politics on KU's beautiful west campus.
  The Dole Institute's official mission is to ``promote political and 
civic participation as well as civil discourse in a bipartisan, 
balanced manner.'' This is precisely what Senator Dole stood for in his 
career, and it is what his legacy, the Dole Institute, promotes today.
  We all congratulate the University of Kansas on the 10-year 
anniversary of the Dole Institute, and congratulate and continue our 
appreciation for Senator Dole and all the work he does for his native 
State of Kansas and for his country.
