                        TRIBUTE TO COREY TAYLOR

<bullet> Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor an 
exceptional Nevadan, Corey Taylor.
  Corey is a sophomore at Las Vegas' Northwest Career and Technical 
Academy and the host of her own radio show, which focuses on bullying 
issues in high schools. She is on a mission to end the senselessness 
that is bullying. Championing a safe environment through activism of 
acceptance, even at a young age, Corey has embraced diversity by 
defending individual expression.
  Overcoming her own situation of adversity is just one example of 
character Corey stands upon as a leader in her community. The hard-
earned money she saves goes to her radio show, where she reaches an 
audience through her words in addition to her actions. She encourages 
people of all ages to surround themselves with positive influences and 
to embrace their unique qualities.
  Through her community outreach, Corey encourages her peers to be true 
to themselves despite any type of social pressure. She refuses to let 
her spirits be diminished by bullying, and her work has inspired others 
to do the same.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and congratulating Corey 
for her service and contributions to Nevada.<bullet>
