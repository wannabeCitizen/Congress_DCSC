                        TENNESSEE NATIONAL GUARD

  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, the President filed his budget 
yesterday, and what a budget it is. It is going to increase spending by 
$791 billion--that is right, billion with a ``b.'' You would think we 
had all this money to spend. And when you look a little deeper, you see 
that the priorities are all askew in this budget.
  I want to point out just one to my colleagues, and it deals with the 
Tennessee National Guard and the way they are being adversely impacted 
by what this budget is bringing to bear, what the President would want 
to bring to bear.
  The Tennessee Guard has flown the Kiowa Warrior helicopters all 
throughout Iraq and Afghanistan. They used them in our natural 
disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the Tennessee flood. And today, 
due to that budget that I have mentioned that the President filed 
yesterday, he would like to put them on the chopping block. All 30 
Kiowa helicopters, 692 soldiers, and 113 workers are all on the 
chopping block.
  Let's talk about priorities. It is our responsibility in the House to 
get this right.
