                      AMERICA'S MILITARY STRENGTH

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the President 
unveiled his budget and used the military as a punching bag to push his 
Big Government programs.
  According to a recent Charleston Post and Courier editorial:

       Congress should proceed with extreme caution before going 
     along with the latest recommendations for ``savings'' through 
     deep defense cuts. If America rapidly retreats from world 
     power status, our enemies will jump into the void. We can't 
     unilaterally end the Islamic radical terrorists' war on us, 
     and we shouldn't ignore history lessons about what happens 
     when the United States tries to isolate itself from the 
     menaces that threaten the international community.

  At a time when threats are increasing and countries on nearly every 
continent are in turmoil, it is naive for the President to downgrade 
our military strength. Maintaining our national defense is the primary 
function of the national government.
  I find it dangerous that the President has suggested this proposal 
which places American families at risk of further attacks. We should 
follow the advice of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Our Nation is still 
at war. Peace through strength.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
