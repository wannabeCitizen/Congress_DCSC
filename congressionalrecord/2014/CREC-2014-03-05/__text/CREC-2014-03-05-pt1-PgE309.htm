          HOMEOWNER FLOOD INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2014

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                           HON. KATHY CASTOR

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, March 4, 2014

  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge all of my 
colleagues to pass H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance 
Affordability Act.
  If this bill passes we will keep middle class families in their 
homes, bring relief to our local economy and provide needed reliability 
to middle class friends and neighbors.
  Since November 2013, I have urged action on flood insurance on every 
bill that moved through the Rules Committee to the floor of the U.S. 
House.
  Families who were facing massive flood insurance premium increases 
will now be able to breathe easier. The reforms will help ensure that 
flood insurance will be there in times of disaster.
  This legislation allows individuals purchasing covered homes to also 
assume the predetermined rates and restores grandfathered properties 
under prior law so that owners would pay rates applicable to the 
original flood risk.
  We have learned that we must keep a close eye on FEMA and flood maps 
and this legislation gives us more tools to do so. I credit the outcry 
many of our neighbors, realtors, chambers of commerce and others who 
helped focus the pressure on the Republican leaders in Congress to act.
  This has been an anxious time for homeowners, but the immense 
pressure by families and the business community on the House GOP was an 
effort that paid off. This Congress has an unfortunate reputation for 
not addressing the challenges that middle class families face. Today, 
we can come together to do just that.
  I thank my Florida colleagues who worked in a bipartisan manner to 
bring relief to more than two million National Flood Insurance Program 
policyholders in our state and I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill.

                          ____________________
