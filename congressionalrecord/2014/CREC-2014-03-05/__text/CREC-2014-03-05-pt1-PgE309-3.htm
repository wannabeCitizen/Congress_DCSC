         UNITED STATES-ISRAEL STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 2014

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                           HON. LOIS FRANKEL

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, March 4, 2014

  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, anyone who turns on the news for 
even a few minutes will see our good friend Israel in a region of chaos 
and unrest.
  War in Syria--with refugees pouring into Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon. 
Violence in Iraq. Upheaval in Egypt. And of course, the threat of 
nuclear advancement in Iran.
  And yet, Israel remains a strong, stable, and reliable ally.
  More than ever, we must do all we can to strengthen our critical 
relationship.
  H.R. 938, the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2013, 
will do just that.
  It designates Israel as a ``major strategic partner'' and increases 
our mutually beneficial cooperation in the areas of energy, science, 
water, agriculture, alternative fuel technologies, and homeland 
security.
  At a time of deep political division in Congress, this bill has 
across the board support, with 351 cosponsors, a reflection that our 
alliance with Israel is rooted in shared national interests, common 
values of democracy and freedom, and a recognition that the same forces 
threatening Israel also threaten the United States.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 938.
