    CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL OF THE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, this year marks the 
100th anniversary of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, which established the 
Cooperative Extension Service. Extension is a unique educational 
partnership among Federal, State, and local governments and the 
Nation's land-grant universities to extend research-based knowledge to 
the American public and private industry.
  Over the years, Extension has connected individuals and families with 
the resources and expertise of our Nation's land-grant university 
system. In Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State University provides this 
educational network, working to help families make sound economic and 
nutritional choices, and help businesses increase efficiency and 
troubleshoot production and industry challenges.
  Madam Speaker, today, the Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences 
is on the Hill with agricultural businesses and industry advocates to 
share with us the importance of the Cooperative Extension Service.
  As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Smith-Lever Act, I want 
to give congratulations and recognition to the outstanding Penn State 
Extension team, which is led by Interim Dean Barb Christ, and thank 
them for their important work to improve the lives and economic 
outcomes of countless families and businesses across the country.
