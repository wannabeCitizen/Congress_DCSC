                             CLOTURE MOTION

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to the 
cloture vote.
  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.
  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, this next nominee, Timothy Brooks of the 
Western District of Arkansas, is excellent in every way. He basically 
has the support from plaintiffs', defendants', and criminal defendants' 
lawyers, prosecutors, Democrats and Republicans, businesses--everybody. 
They really like this nominee is the total consensus on him. He has 
been waiting for a long time. We tried to get this going last year and 
got caught up in end-of-the-year stuff.
  I ask all my colleagues to vote yes on the procedure and on 
confirming him.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Arkansas is 
recognized.

[[Page S1303]]

  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I share my support for the nominee on 
whom we are about to vote.
  Judge Timothy Brooks has the experience, background, and temperament 
to unanimously qualify him for the position of district judge. I am 
proud to stand before my colleagues and offer my support of his 
confirmation. I am pleased that we have been able to act on this 
vacancy and hope that Judge Brooks will be easily confirmed much like 
Judge Moody was for the Eastern District of Arkansas seat last week.
  Again, these are highly qualified nominees. Judge Moody is a great 
fit for the Eastern District. I am confident Judge Brooks will 
complement him well in the Western District. One of the most important 
aspects of what we do in the Senate is the confirmation of judges, the 
process of selecting people with the right temperament and 
qualifications. I believe both Judge Moody and Judge Brooks will make 
excellent Federal judges and will make Arkansas proud.
  I yield the floor.


                             Cloture Motion

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.
  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending
