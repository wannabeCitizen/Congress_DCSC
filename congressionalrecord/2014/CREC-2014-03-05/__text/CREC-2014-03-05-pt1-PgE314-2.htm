    HONORING MIDFIELD HIGH SCHOOL AS ALABAMA'S CLASS 3A BOY'S STATE 
                          BASKETBALL CHAMPIONS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. TERRI A. SEWELL

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
the Midfield High School Patriots for their victory in the 2014 Class 
3A Alabama State Basketball Championship. On behalf of the 7th 
Congressional District, I congratulate the Patriots for the tremendous 
athleticism and teamwork they displayed throughout the season under the 
outstanding leadership of Head Coach Darrell Barber and his coaching 
staff. Midfield High School won its second state championship in three 
years with its victory over Barbour County on Saturday, March 1. These 
young men and their coaches pursued excellence and were driven by hard 
work and determination during every game of the season. The Patriots 
finished the season undefeated in their region and lost only 7 games 
overall.
  As the daughter of a high school basketball coach, I know this 
decisive victory is the result of the tremendous efforts of both the 
players and coaching staff of Midfield High School. Coach Barber is 
known for setting high expectations for his players and assisting them 
in meeting those expectations. The exemplary leadership and dedicated 
support from the coaching staff was a major factor in the success of 
the Midfield Patriots.
  In the championship game, the Midfield Patriots defeated Barbour 
County by 22 points for a final score of 62-40. The Patriots forced 11 
turnovers, but only gave up the ball seven times.
  In the second half, the Midfield Patriots led by as many as 25 points 
and never less than 13 points. During the entire fourth quarter, the 
Patriots never led by less than 20 points. Tournament MVP Aaron Gaines 
scored 22 points with four 3-pointers. Alvin Murry completed the game 
with 15 points and 10 rebounds. Jermaine Turner scored 11 points and 
made eight assists and seven rebounds.
  Following the victory, Head Coach Darrell Barber thanked God, his 
family and the Midfield community for supporting the Patriots 
throughout the season. He explained how the nay-sayers gave the team 
motivation making them more dedicated to win. ``It gave us a little 
fuel,'' he told Al.com following the victory. ``As you all know myself 
and my guys, we play with a chip on our shoulder and we coach with a 
chip on our shoulder to get this program recognition.''
  Winning the state championship is a proud moment these boys achieved 
through hard work and commitment. Members of the team include: Eric 
Billups, Kelvin Eatmon, Aaron Gaines, Ahmad Isaac, Derrick Morse, 
Jabril Muhammad, Alvin Murry, Joseph Murry, Jeremy Shields, Jermaine 
Turner, and Cedric Russell.

  I would like to commend the Midfield coaching staff under the 
leadership of Head Coach Darrell Barber and the assistant coaches 
including Coaches Matthew Epps, Courtney Jones, and Charles Thomas and 
the bus driver, Mr. Rod Isaac.
  On behalf of the 7th Congressional District, the State of Alabama and 
this nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the 
accomplishments of the Midfield High School Boys Basketball Team for 
their victory in the Class 3A Alabama State Championship. 
Congratulations. Go Patriots.
