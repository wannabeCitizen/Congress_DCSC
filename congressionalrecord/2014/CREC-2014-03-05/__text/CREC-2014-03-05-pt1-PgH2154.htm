               HARRY REID V. JUSTIN CARTER RE: OBAMACARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. Brooks) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, in September of 2013, Democrat 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sought to marginalize and denigrate 
Americans who believe in America's foundational principles by calling 
them anarchists and fanatics.

                              {time}  1030

  Their offense? They exercised their First Amendment freedom of speech 
rights by speaking out against and opposing ObamaCare and socialized 
medicine.
  In February 2014, Democrat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sought 
to marginalize and denigrate Charles Koch and Dave Koch by calling them 
``as un-American as anyone that I can imagine.'' Their offense? They 
exercised their freedom of speech rights by exposing how badly 
ObamaCare hurts millions of Americans.
  Also in February 2014, Democrat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 
brazenly proclaimed that all those pesky Americans who dare exercise 
their freedom of speech rights by complaining about ObamaCare are all 
telling lies. Mr. Reid said:

       There's plenty of horror stories being told. All of them 
     are untrue, but they're being told all over America.

  Mr. Reid's calling Americans liars puts me in a quandary because 
north Alabama citizens often complain to me about ObamaCare. Who should 
I believe, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid or north Alabama citizens?
  This week, Justin Carter of C&C Fabrication, a 47-year-old family-
owned business in Laceys Spring, Alabama, told me:

       C&C Fabrication was formed by two brothers, Ray and C.M. 
     Carter, in 1967 and is today a small, family-owned and 
     family-operated business. Through hard work and strong 
     leadership, C&C has grown to over 100,000 square feet, with 
     51 skilled workers. Even as the ObamaCare corporate mandate 
     has been delayed, its imminent implementation forces C&C to 
     make very serious, very real decisions regarding its future. 
     C&C's health care premiums increased by over 10 percent in 
     October 2013. C&C has been notified that an additional 15 
     percent increase is coming in October 2014.
       These increases will cost C&C almost $70,000 per year in 
     increased health care premiums alone, and these increases do 
     not even fully capture the impact of the corporate mandates. 
     In order to fully comply with ObamaCare, C&C must restructure 
     its benefits package for all employees, as well as each 
     worker's hourly pay rate. These increased costs could rise as 
     high as $160,000 per year.
       Failure to comply with ObamaCare will result in over 
     $120,000 per year in fines for C&C; however, noncompliance 
     could actually be the most prudent, most financially sound 
     method of survival for C&C but at a cost to its employees in 
     the form of benefit reductions, many of whom have been 
     employed by C&C for decades. This would force C&C employees 
     to the exchanges to buy plans with worse coverage and with 
     higher deductibles than is currently provided to them by C&C.
       The sad reality is that because of ObamaCare and uncertain 
     economic times, C&C will likely have only one feasible choice 
     for the survival of the company, and that is to ensure that 
     its corporate size stays below the limit of 50 employees. 
     While this will exempt C&C Fabrication from ObamaCare and 
     help it survive, it will also sacrifice the jobs of valued 
     employees and cap the earning potential of the company, 
     ensuring that this small business will not grow or create 
     jobs.
       C&C has been fortunate to serve the community into its 
     third generation and has taken pride in the work it performs. 
     Many hardworking individuals have given service to C&C, and, 
     in turn, C&C has done its very best to provide them with a 
     living. However, ObamaCare mandates have the potential to 
     derail C&C's future and greatly threaten its survival.

  So who is telling the truth about how badly ObamaCare is damaging 
America? Justin Carter, a north Alabama citizen and job creator, or 
Democrat Senator Harry Reid, who is desperate to keep his job even to 
the point of denigrating American citizens who dare to exercise their 
freedom of speech rights? Well, I know Justin Carter and the Carter 
family, and I know Harry Reid. Quite frankly, I believe Justin Carter 
of north Alabama is telling the truth about ObamaCare hurting 
Americans. And, Mr. Speaker, it is not a close call.
