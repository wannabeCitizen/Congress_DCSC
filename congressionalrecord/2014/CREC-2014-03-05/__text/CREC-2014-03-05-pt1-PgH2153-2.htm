                QUIZ: WHO IS THE ``DEPORTER-IN-CHIEF''?

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I have come to the floor to discuss a 
very serious illness afflicting Members of the U.S. House of 
Representatives. Dana Milbank of The Washington Post diagnosed it as 
``Obama derangement syndrome.''
  Milbank defined the syndrome as an affliction in which: ``The 
President's opponents are so determined to thwart him that they will 
reverse long-held views if they believe it will weaken his stature.''
  I would define it as a broader and more serious condition, the 
irrational fear that the 44th President of the United States of America 
is something he is not.
  From a public health standpoint, the news is pretty bad. Those of us 
concerned with the long-term health of the

body politic have identified an aggressive fact-resistant strain of 
Obama derangement syndrome that affects how the Republican Caucus views 
immigration enforcement.
  Remember, the Republicans are currently sitting on their hands when 
it comes to immigration reform because they say they cannot trust the 
President of the United States to enforce immigration laws.
  Well, I thought it would be a good time to offer a quiz to determine 
just how fact-resistant the current epidemic of Obama derangement 
syndrome really is.
  Here we have the last three Presidents of the United States: Bill 
Clinton, George Bush, and Barack Obama. Mr. Speaker, let's test our 
knowledge of how much or how little they have enforced the immigration 
laws of the United States during their terms.
  Question one: Which President deported a population slightly larger 
than the population of the entire State of Nebraska, with almost 2 
million deported so far?
  Barack Obama has deported more people than the number living in the 
entire State of Nebraska. No one has deported more people. A star for 
first place goes to Barack Obama.
  Question two: Who expanded immigration enforcement by local law 
enforcement a hundredfold? One of these Presidents expanded the Secure 
Communities program for deporting immigrants who are booked into local 
jails from 31 jurisdictions in this Nation to over 3,000.
  And who was that? Yes, President Barack Obama, another dubious star.
  Question number three: Let's go to ``boots on the ground,'' where the 
immigration issue seems to begin and end for many Republicans. Who 
spent more money on immigration enforcement than all other Federal law 
enforcement combined? Well, if you guessed Barack Obama, you would be 
right.
  Yes, the $18 billion he spends is $3.5 billion more every year than 
we spend on the FBI, ATF, DEA, and Secret Service--all of them 
combined--in order to achieve what? Unprecedented deportations, so he 
gets another star.
  Question four: What crimes are the most prosecuted crimes in Federal 
court? Do you think kidnapping, murder, counterfeiting, political 
corruption?
  No. Under Barack Obama, the number one crime prosecuted as a 
misdemeanor is being illegally in this country. And the number one 
crime prosecuted as a felony in Federal courts is what? Illegal reentry 
to the United States. He gets another star.
  Finally, for question five, we get to detention. Which of these 
Presidents put more than 420,000 people in detention in just one single 
year of his presidency? Yes, arrested and put them in jail.
  President Barack Obama has detained more immigrants in jails, 
prisons, and detention facilities than any other President of the 
United States of America.
  That is five for five, and it goes to the deporter-in-chief, Barack 
Obama; but because Obama derangement syndrome is so fact-resistant, I 
am not optimistic I have convinced anybody this morning, but tell that 
to the more than 5,000 American citizen children who today sit in 
foster care because their moms or dads have been deported.
  Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. The immigrant community is organized and 
will continue to pressure Republicans and the President until this 
unprecedented wave of deportation ends.
  Republicans can either be participants in how this country advances 
more sensible immigration policies, or they can just simply sit on the 
sidelines while the President does it with his phone and his pen.
  And secondly, if we pass immigration reform in this body today, most 
of the new reforms won't take place for about 2 years. Obama won't even 
be President of the United States of America.
  In fact, if Republicans continue to insist on making immigration 
reform a football in their game against the current President, they are 
all but guaranteeing that the President in 2 years will not be a member 
of your party--not a member of the Republican Party--and could very 
well be the wife of one of these three gentlemen.
