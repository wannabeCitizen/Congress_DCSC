                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

                                  _____
                                 

                     HON. CHARLES W. BOUSTANY, JR.

                              of louisiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, due to inclement weather on the morning of 
Tuesday, March 4, my flight was unable to leave for Washington, DC, 
from Lafayette, Louisiana. Therefore, I was unable to return in time 
for votes. Had I been present to vote, my voting record would reflect 
the following: H.R. 3370--``yea''; H. Res. 488--``yea.''
  I also offer the following statement in favor of the Homeowner Flood 
Insurance Affordability Act:
  I support H.R. 3370, responsible legislation keeping thousands of 
Louisiana homeowners from facing dramatic increases in their flood 
insurance premiums.
  The National Flood Insurance Program must be financially sustainable 
and it is irresponsible for it to carry a debt of $24 billion.
  However, we must find a balance between fiscal stability and 
punishing homeowners who followed the rules. This legislation brings 
fairness to homeowners and much-needed stability to the NFIP.
  I am pleased this bill restores the grandfathering provision, the 
home improvement provision clause, and provides meaningful protection 
to Pre-Firm properties. I look forward to FEMA improving the flood 
mapping process to help inform the decision-makers in communities 
across America.
  Local leaders must be vigilant in managing the growth of our 
neighborhoods in South Louisiana to ensure they are using the best 
available data to drive our zoning requirements, our building codes, 
and our insurance ratings.
  Congress must remain engaged in its oversight of this program and its 
implementation in the years ahead. It must be committed to finding 
creative ways to further strengthen the NFIP without harming policy 
holders or the general public.
