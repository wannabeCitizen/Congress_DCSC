                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear Lord, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We use this moment to be reminded of Your presence and to tap the 
resources needed by the Members of this people's House to do their work 
as well as it can be done.
  As the world observes the tensions mounting within Ukraine and 
Venezuela, may we all note well the crippling effects of ideological 
divides

[[Page H2157]]

when a shared sense of national unity might bring greater hope and 
possible solution to serious political problems.
  Send, O God, Your healing grace upon those torn nations and upon the 
Members of this assembly who struggle to see the shared hope for a 
better future in those with whom they disagree.
  All this day and through the week, may our Representatives do their 
best to find solutions to pressing issues facing our Nation. Please 
hasten the day when justice and love shall dwell in the hearts of all 
peoples and rule the affairs of the nations of Earth.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
