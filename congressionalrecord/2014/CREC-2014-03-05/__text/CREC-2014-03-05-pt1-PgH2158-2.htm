                             NUCLEAR ENERGY

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, as a business owner of 42 years, I know 
a few things about job creation, and with more than 10 million 
Americans out of work, it is time to energize the energy business. We 
need to let the private sector drive our initiatives and promote the 
advancement of safe nuclear energy.
  Nuclear power sustains 100,000 high-paying jobs, and 2,000 of those 
are in Texas facilities. In my district, the 25th District of Texas, 
there are hundreds of highly skilled workers at the Comanche Peak 
Nuclear Plant who are doing a great job and are doing great things to 
promote this clean, reliable, and inexpensive energy source, less 
expensive than coal or natural gas.
  Texas plays a vital national and international role in the 
development of new technologies and is among the 10 States with the 
greatest nuclear power generation capacity in the whole country.
  Nuclear energy should play a major role in our Nation's all-inclusive 
energy plan, and that is why our policies should support it. Nuclear 
creates good jobs, puts billions of dollars into our economy, and is a 
safe, clean, and reliable energy source we simply can't afford to 
ignore. Let's move forward. In God we trust.
