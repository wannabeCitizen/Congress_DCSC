                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, on January 20, 2009, the day President 
Obama took office, the national debt was $10,626,877,048,913.08.
  Today, it is $17,444,385,246,890.50. We've added 
$6,817,508,197,977.42 to our debt in 5 years. This is over $6.8 
trillion in debt our nation, our economy, and our children could have 
avoided with a balanced budget amendment.
