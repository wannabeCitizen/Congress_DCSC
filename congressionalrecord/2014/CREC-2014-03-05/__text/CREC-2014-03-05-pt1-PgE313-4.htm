                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor an Olympic athlete 
from Washington State's 8th District, Mr. Patrick Deneen. Mr. Deneen 
just returned from representing our nation in the XXII Olympic Winter 
Games in Sochi, Russia. Mr. Deneen is an incredible athlete who has 
reached the pinnacle of his sport and achieved a well-deserved 6th 
place finish in the Men's Moguls event.
  I applaud both his achievement and the hard work and perseverance 
that paid off during these games. Simply to attend the Olympics is an 
honor, and to do so well is a testament to everything Mr. Deneen has 
accomplished. I thank him for representing America so well, and I am 
proud to call him a constituent and a Washingtonian.

                          ____________________
